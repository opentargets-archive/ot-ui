# Open Targets UI

This repo contains reusable React components for Open Targets projects. It is currently being used within [Open Targets Genetics](https://github.com/opentargets/genetics-app), but may be used on other Open Targets projects in the future.

The overarching Open Targets Genetics project is described [here](https://github.com/opentargets/genetics), which is also where issues can be raised.

## Installation
